# **Explainable AI for Respiratory Disease Classification**

## **📌 Project Overview**
This project focuses on using **Artificial Intelligence (AI) to classify respiratory diseases** based on lung sound recordings. Since lung sounds like **crackles and wheezes** can indicate conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia, early detection is crucial for timely medical intervention.

To enhance trust and transparency in AI predictions, this project integrates **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** to explain how the model makes its decisions.

## **🔍 Key Features**
- **AI-driven Lung Sound Classification**: Predicts whether lung sounds belong to one of four categories: **Crackles, Wheezes, Both, or Neither**.
- **Stacking Model & CNN**: Combines multiple models to improve classification accuracy.
- **LIME for Explainability**: Helps visualize why the model made a particular prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for healthcare professionals and researchers.

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow (for CNNs)**
- **LIME (for Explainability)**
- **Streamlit (for interactive visualization)**


## **📊 Why Lung Sounds Matter**
Lung sounds are a valuable diagnostic tool because:
- **Crackles** often indicate **fluid buildup** in the lungs, seen in pneumonia or heart failure.
- **Wheezes** suggest **narrowed airways**, common in asthma or bronchitis.
- Detecting abnormal sounds early can help in **preventing severe respiratory issues**.


- Upload an audio file of lung sounds.
- The model predicts the category (Crackles, Wheezes, Both, or Neither).
- LIME provides a visual explanation of why the model made its decision.

## **📈 Model Performance**
- **Stacking Model & CNN Combination** improves classification accuracy.
- **LIME Explanations** make the results more interpretable for medical professionals.

## **📝 Future Improvements**
- Improve model accuracy with **larger datasets**.
- Add support for **real-time lung sound analysis**.
- Further refine **explainability techniques** for clinical use.
